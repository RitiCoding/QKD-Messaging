FUNCTION MAP

1. measure_time(func, *args, **kwargs)
   - Measures the execution time of a function.
   - Returns the function result and elapsed time.

2. collect_data()
   - Runs various cryptographic tests and collects performance metrics.
   - Steps:
     - Generates a QKD key and measures time.
     - Computes key entropy.
     - Encrypts and decrypts data with AES and measures time.
     - Simulates bandwidth overhead.
     - Simulates error rate with noise.
     - Detects eavesdropping attempts.
     - Compares AES encryption times.
   - Returns collected data.

3. brute_force_time(key_length, quantum=True, classical_speed=1e9)
   - Estimates brute force time for a key based on classical or quantum computing.
   - Returns estimated time in seconds.

4. display_time(seconds)
   - Converts time in seconds into a human-readable format.
   - Returns formatted time string.

5. compare_brute_force(qkd_key_length, aes_key_length, quantum=False)
   - Compares brute force times for QKD and AES keys.
   - Prints a formatted comparison.

6. estimate_computing_power(key_length_bits, num_qubits, num_repetitions, clock_speed_ghz)
   - Estimates computational power required for QKD simulation.
   - Returns total operations and estimated time in seconds.

7. display_results(total_operations, time_required_seconds, clock_speed_ghz)
   - Displays the QKD simulation results in a readable format.

8. __main__
   - Executes the following:
     - Runs collect_data() to gather performance metrics.
     - Initializes QKD simulation.
     - Generates QKD key and measures length.
     - Compares classical and quantum brute force times.
     - Estimates computing power required for QKD.
     - Displays results.
